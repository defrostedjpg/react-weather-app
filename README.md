# React-Weather-App

A barebones weather app made with Shadcn and React

I may update this repo in the future for desktop compatibility

Install npm modules

`cd react-weather-app`

`npm install`

Run the project locally

`npm run dev`
## Libraries & Plugins

- React.js
- Tailwind CSS
- Recharts
- Shadcn


## Lessons Learned

I became more familiar with React.js and working with Shadcn components with the help of generative AI and learned that some component libraries aren't compatible with Tailwind CSS.

I also learnt how to modify and implement Shadcn charts.
